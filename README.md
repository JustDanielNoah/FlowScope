## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration

Flow Scope was born from a personal experience with heart disease in the family. The project is driven by the belief that everyday health data should be more than just numbersâ€”it should help save lives. Our goal is to give users the tools they need to take control of their heart health before it's too late.
